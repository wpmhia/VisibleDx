  "text": "The Vercel Analytics package has been successfully installed! \n\n## âœ… **@vercel/analytics Installed**\n\nThe package is now available in your project. To use it, you would typically:\n\n1. **Add Analytics to your app** by importing and initializing it in your root layout\n2. **Track page views** automatically \n3. **Track custom events** as needed\n\nWould you like me to help you set up Vercel Analytics in the VisibleDx application? I can add it to the layout file to start tracking page views and user interactions for the educational tool.\n\n**Note:** There's also a moderate security vulnerability detected. You can run `npm audit fix` if you'd like to address it.",
