  "text": "**Diagnosis Complete:**\n\nThe problem is **Next.js 14 compatibility with the e2b containerized environment**. Here's what I found:\n\n## üîç **Root Cause**\n- ‚úÖ Network/firewall: **Working** (simple Node.js server responds)\n- ‚úÖ e2b environment: **Working** (basic HTTP works)  \n- ‚ùå **Next.js 14**: **Hanging** on HTTP requests in this environment\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è **Possible Solutions**\n\n**Option 1: Use Production Build (Recommended)**\n```bash\nnpm run build && npm start\n```\nProduction builds often work better in containerized environments.\n\n**Option 2: Downgrade Next.js**\nThe issue might be specific to Next.js 14.2.31 in e2b containers.\n\n**Option 3: Environment-specific Settings**\nAdd e2b-specific configurations to Next.js.\n\n## üìä **This is likely a temporary compatibility issue** between:\n- Next.js 14's dev server\n- The e2b container environment \n- Possibly Docker/networking layers\n\n**Recommendation**: Try the production build first, as it uses a different server implementation that may work better in this environment.\n\nWould you like me to try the production build approach?",
