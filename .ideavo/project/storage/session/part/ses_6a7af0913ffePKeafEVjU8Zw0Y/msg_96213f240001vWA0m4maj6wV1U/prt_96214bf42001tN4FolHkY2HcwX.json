  "text": "Perfect! I've successfully replaced the Bug icon with a custom virus icon in your navigation. Here's what I did:\n\n1. **Created a custom VirusIcon component** (`/home/user/project/components/virus-icon.tsx`) that renders a proper SVG virus icon with:\n   - A central circular body\n   - Surface proteins/spikes around the perimeter\n   - Internal structure details\n   - Proper scaling and color inheritance\n\n2. **Updated the navigation component** to:\n   - Import the new `VirusIcon` component\n   - Remove the `Bug` icon import\n   - Replace both instances of the Bug icon (desktop logo and mobile menu) with the custom VirusIcon\n\nThe custom virus icon:\n- Matches the visual style of your medical application\n- Uses the same blue color (`text-blue-600`) as your existing design\n- Scales properly with different sizes (24px for desktop, 20px for mobile)\n- Is built as a proper SVG component for crisp rendering at any size\n\nThe virus icon now appears in both the main logo and the mobile menu header, giving your medical screening application a more appropriate and professional look that better represents its purpose.",
