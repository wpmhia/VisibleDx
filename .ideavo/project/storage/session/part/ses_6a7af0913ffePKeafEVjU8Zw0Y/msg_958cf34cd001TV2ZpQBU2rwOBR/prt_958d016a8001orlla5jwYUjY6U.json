  "text": "Perfect! The build is successful. The React hooks violation has been fixed. The development server should still be running on port 4000, and now the new patient assessment should work properly without getting stuck on loading after the red flag step.\n\n## Summary\n\n**Fixed:** The loading issue in the new patient assessment was caused by a React hooks violation. The `useEffect` hook was being called conditionally inside an `if` statement in the criteria processing step.\n\n**Changes made:**\n1. Moved the `useEffect` hook to the top level of the component (after other hooks)\n2. Added a condition inside the `useEffect` to only run when `currentStep === 'criteria'`\n3. Removed the conditional `useEffect` from the criteria step section\n\nThe new patient assessment should now progress properly through all steps without hanging on loading screens.",
