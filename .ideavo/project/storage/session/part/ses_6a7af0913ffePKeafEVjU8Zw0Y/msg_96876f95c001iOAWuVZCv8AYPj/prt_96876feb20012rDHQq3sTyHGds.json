Completed a full modernization project with 12 major updates:\n\n**Core Modules Updated:**\n- **Quick Screen Tool** - Updated with NICE's 4 core symptoms (debilitating fatigue, PEM, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive difficulties)\n- **Red Flag Checker** - Integrated mandatory NICE NG206 differential diagnosis investigations\n- **PEM Quest Tool** - Revised to align with NICE post-exertional malaise definition and assessment\n- **Criteria Engine** - Updated with NICE diagnostic criteria and 3-month symptom timeline\n- **Energy Management Tool** - **Brand new comprehensive module** created from scratch based on NICE energy management principles\n\n**Clinical Content Overhaul:**\n- Removed outdated GET (Graded Exercise Therapy) references per NICE guidelines\n- Added evidence-based energy management and pacing strategies\n- Updated all clinical guidance to reflect current best practices\n- Integrated proper differential diagnosis workflows\n\n### Current Status:\n**Build Error Blocking Progress** - Syntax error in translations file preventing app from building and testing\n\n### Files Currently Being Modified:\n- **Primary Issue**: `/home/user/project/lib/translations/en.ts` (line 458 - semicolon instead of comma)\n- **Recently Updated**: All major tool pages, main navigation, and clinical content\n- **New File Created**: `/home/user/project/app/energy-management/page.tsx`\n\n### Immediate Next Steps:\n1. **Fix syntax error** in translations file (change semicolon to comma on line 458)\n2. **Run build test** to verify all updates work correctly\n3. **Test new Energy Management module** functionality\n4. **Final NICE NG206 compliance verification** across all updated modules\n\n### Key Achievement:\nTransformed the app from a basic screening tool to a **full clinical decision support system** that helps healthcare providers properly diagnose and manage ME/CFS according to current UK clinical guidelines. The app now provides evidence-based assessment workflows and proper energy management guidance instead of outdated approaches.",
