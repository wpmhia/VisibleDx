  "text": "**Analysis: The Camera PPG feature is NOT actually implemented.**\n\nHere's what I found:\n\n## Current State:\n1. **UI Only**: The Stand Test page shows a \"Camera PPG\" option in the setup, but it's just UI elements\n2. **No Implementation**: There's no actual camera access, video processing, or PPG algorithm\n3. **Manual Input Only**: Even when \"camera\" mode is selected, it still uses manual heart rate input fields\n4. **Missing Components**: No camera preview, no real-time heart rate detection, no photoplethysmography processing\n\n## What's Actually There:\n- A toggle between \"manual\" and \"camera\" methods (line 39)\n- UI cards showing the camera option (lines 335-348)  \n- Translation keys for camera setup text\n- But **no functional difference** - both methods use the same manual input form\n\n## What's Missing for Real PPG:\n- Camera access (`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`)\n- Video stream processing\n- PPG signal analysis algorithms\n- Real-time heart rate calculation from camera data\n- Finger detection and placement guidance\n\n**Answer: No, the Camera PPG feature is not implemented. It's currently just a placeholder UI that falls back to manual heart rate entry regardless of which option is selected.**\n\nWould you like me to implement the actual Camera PPG functionality for real heart rate measurement using the device camera?",
