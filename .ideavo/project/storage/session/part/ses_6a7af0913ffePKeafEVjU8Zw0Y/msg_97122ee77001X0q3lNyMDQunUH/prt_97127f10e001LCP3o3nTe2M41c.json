  "text": "Perfect! The remaining NICE NG206 references are all in appropriate contexts:\n\n1. **Red Flag Checker** - NICE NG206 investigations (appropriate since this refers to specific NICE guidance on differential diagnosis)\n2. **PEM Quest results** - NICE NG206 specific guidance on PEM (appropriate since this refers to specific NICE criteria)\n3. **Energy Management recommendations** - NICE NG206 principles (appropriate since this refers to specific NICE guidance)\n4. **ME/CFS specific criteria** - NICE NG206 criteria (appropriate since this refers to the specific NICE guideline)\n\nThese are all appropriate because they specifically reference NICE NG206 guidance where it's relevant, rather than branding the entire multi-guideline tools as \"NICE NG206\" tools.\n\n## ‚úÖ **NICE NG206 Branding Successfully Removed!**\n\n### **üéØ What Was Changed:**\n\n#### **1. Multi-Framework Modules Updated:**\n- **Case Analyzer:** Now presents as \"Multi-framework clinical case analysis\" instead of \"NICE NG206-focused\"\n- **Criteria Engine:** Changed from \"NICE NG206 Diagnostic Criteria Engine\" ‚Üí \"Diagnostic Criteria Engine\"\n- **Energy Management:** Changed from \"NICE NG206 Energy Management\" ‚Üí \"Energy Management\"\n- **Quick Screen:** Removed NICE NG206 branding from core assessment logic\n- **PEM Quest:** Updated to use \"Clinical Assessment\" instead of \"NICE NG206 Assessment\"\n\n#### **2. Code Comments & Variables:**\n- Updated all internal comments from \"NICE NG206\" ‚Üí \"Clinical\" or generic terms\n- Changed variable names like `niceCoreCriteria` ‚Üí `clinicalCoreCriteria`\n- Removed NICE NG206 from function descriptions and technical documentation\n\n#### **3. User-Facing Text:**\n- Module titles and descriptions now emphasize multi-guideline support\n- Removed \"NICE NG206\" from headlines where multiple frameworks are involved\n- Updated placeholder text to show examples across different conditions (POTS, PAIS, Long COVID)\n\n#### **4. Translation Files:**\n- Updated module descriptions in English, Danish, and Dutch\n- Changed from \"NICE NG206 tool\" ‚Üí \"Clinical tool\" where appropriate\n- Maintained NICE NG206 references only where specifically relevant\n\n### **üîç What Was Preserved:**\n- **Specific NICE guidance sections** still reference NICE NG206 where appropriate\n- **Red Flag investigations** still mention NICE NG206 (since they implement specific NICE guidance)\n- **Energy management principles** that are specifically from NICE NG206\n- **ME/CFS criteria sections** that specifically implement NICE NG206 criteria\n\n### **üöÄ Result:**\nThe app now presents as a **comprehensive multi-guideline diagnostic platform** that happens to include NICE NG206 among many other guidelines (ESC, WHO, AAS-EFAS, etc.), rather than appearing to be primarily a NICE NG206 tool.\n\nUsers will now see it as supporting **all major diagnostic frameworks** equally, making it more appealing to clinicians who use different guidelines or work in different healthcare systems! üåç",
