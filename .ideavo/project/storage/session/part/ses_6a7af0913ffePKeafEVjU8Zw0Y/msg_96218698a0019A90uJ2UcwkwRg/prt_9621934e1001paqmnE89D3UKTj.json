  "text": "Perfect! I've successfully updated the virus icon with your provided component. Here's what I changed:\n\n1. **Replaced the virus icon component** with your detailed version that includes:\n   - A professional virus structure with spikes radiating outward\n   - Inner and outer circular elements\n   - Internal spots representing virus components\n   - Proper accessibility features (title, aria-label)\n\n2. **Updated the navigation component** to:\n   - Import the new default export\n   - Pass `outlineColor=\"currentColor\"` to make it inherit the blue color from the CSS class\n   - Maintain the proper sizing (24px for desktop, 20px for mobile)\n\nThe new virus icon is much more detailed and professional-looking, with:\n- **8 directional spikes** extending from the central body\n- **Multiple internal elements** showing virus structure\n- **Customizable colors** (using `currentColor` to inherit the blue theme)\n- **Proper SVG accessibility** with title and aria-label\n- **Scalable design** that works at different sizes\n\nThe icon now perfectly matches your medical screening application's professional appearance while maintaining the blue color scheme (`text-blue-600`) from your existing design system.",
