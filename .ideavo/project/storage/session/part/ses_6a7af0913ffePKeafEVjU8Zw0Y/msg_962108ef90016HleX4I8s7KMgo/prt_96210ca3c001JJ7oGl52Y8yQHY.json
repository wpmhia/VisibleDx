  "text": "Based on the available Lucide React icons, here are some alternatives that might be closer to a virus icon:\n\n1. `Zap` - Lightning bolt (represents energy/pathogen)\n2. `Target` - Circular target shape \n3. `Hexagon` - Geometric virus-like shape\n4. `Circle` - Simple circular shape\n5. `Atom` - Scientific/molecular structure\n\nWould you like me to try one of these, or would you prefer to:\n1. **Provide the SVG code** for your virus icon so I can create a custom component\n2. **Convert your image to SVG** format first and then provide the SVG code\n3. **Try a different approach** like using the `Atom` icon which has a molecular/scientific look\n\nWhich option would you prefer?",
