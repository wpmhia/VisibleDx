  "text": "Perfect! The InvisibleDx application is now running successfully on **http://localhost:3000**.\n\nThe \"loading\" issue you encountered was because the server had stopped running. This likely happened because:\n\n1. **Server timeout**: The production server may have automatically stopped after inactivity\n2. **Build invalidation**: Our changes required a fresh build\n\n**The application is now ready with all the InvisibleDx updates:**\n- ✅ **New branding**: InvisibleDx name throughout\n- ✅ **New logo**: EyeOff icon (representing invisible conditions)\n- ✅ **New domain**: InvisibleDx.com references\n- ✅ **Server running**: http://localhost:3000\n\nYou can now test the application again and should see the updated InvisibleDx branding with the EyeOff icon in the navigation.",
