  "text": "## ✅ Propranolol Dosing Corrected Based on Medical Guidelines\n\n**Guideline Verification:**\nI checked the authoritative POTS treatment guidelines from **Dr. Satish Raj at Vanderbilt University** (a leading POTS research center), published in the Indian Pacing and Electrophysiology Journal.\n\n**Finding:**\nThe guideline specifically states:\n> \"When used in low doses, beta-adrenergic antagonists can be useful. We typical use propranolol 10-20 mg PO **BID-QID**. While this dose range is small, such doses can often have a significant impact on heart rate control, and higher doses are often not tolerated due to hypotension and fatigue.\"\n\n**Correction Made:**\n- **Before**: \"Propranolol 10-40mg BID\" \n- **After**: \"Propranolol 10-20mg BID-QID\" ✅\n\n**Why This Change is Important:**\n1. **Dose Range**: Guidelines recommend 10-20mg (not 10-40mg) \n2. **Frequency**: Can be given 2-4 times daily (BID-QID) depending on patient response and tolerance\n3. **Medical Accuracy**: Now matches the evidence-based recommendations from leading POTS experts\n4. **Clinical Safety**: Lower maximum dose reduces risk of hypotension and fatigue\n\n**Updated Across All 7 Languages:**\n- English, Dutch, Danish, German, Swedish, Norwegian, and French translations all now reflect the correct evidence-based dosing recommendation.\n\nThe VisibleDx application now provides accurate, guideline-concordant propranolol dosing recommendations for hyperadrenergic POTS treatment!",
