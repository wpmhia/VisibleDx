  "text": "## Conversation Summary\n\n### What Was Done\n- **Identified and diagnosed a React hooks error**: The main issue was `useEffect` being called conditionally inside an `if` statement in a component, which violates the Rules of Hooks\n- **Located the problematic code**: Found that hooks were being used conditionally rather than at the top level of the component\n\n### Current Issue\n- **Rules of Hooks violation**: `useEffect` (and potentially other hooks) are being called conditionally, which React doesn't allow\n- **Build/runtime errors**: This is likely causing the application to fail or behave unexpectedly\n\n### Files Being Modified\n- The exact file wasn't specified in the visible conversation, but it appears to be a React component file where hooks are being used conditionally\n\n### What Needs to Be Done Next\n1. **Fix the hooks violation** by moving all hooks (especially `useEffect`) to the top level of the component, outside any conditional statements\n2. **Restructure conditional logic** to handle conditions inside the hook callbacks rather than conditionally calling the hooks themselves\n3. **Test the fix** to ensure the application builds and runs without the hooks error\n4. **Verify functionality** remains intact after the structural changes\n\n### Key Technical Context\n- Working with a Next.js 14 App Router project\n- Using React 18 with TypeScript\n- Following React's Rules of Hooks which require hooks to always be called in the same order at the top level of components\n- The fix involves refactoring conditional hook usage to proper React patterns\n\nThe immediate priority is resolving this React hooks violation to restore application functionality.",
