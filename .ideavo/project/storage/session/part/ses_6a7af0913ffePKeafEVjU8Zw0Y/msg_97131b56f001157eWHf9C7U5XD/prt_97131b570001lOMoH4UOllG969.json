If you want printable quick‑reference cards or ICD codes, tell me which and I’ll provide them.\n\nME/CFS (ICD-10: G93.3) — Core diagnostic criteria (based on 2015 IOM/NAM and international consensus)\nRequired duration:\nSubstantial reduction/impairment in ability to engage in pre-illness levels of activity, lasting >6 months in adults (children may be shorter but usually >3 months).\nCore symptoms (all three required):\nSubstantial reduction in function with profound fatigue that is new or definite onset (not lifelong), not explained by ongoing excessive exertion, and not substantially alleviated by rest.\nPost-exertional malaise (PEM): worsening of symptoms and/or reduction in function after physical, cognitive, or emotional effort; often delayed onset and prolonged recovery.\nUnrefreshing sleep.\nPlus at least one of the following:\nCognitive impairment (e.g., slowed processing, memory problems, attention deficits), and/or\nOrthostatic intolerance (symptoms worsen on standing; may include POTS, neurally mediated hypotension).\nExclude other medical/psychiatric conditions that fully explain the symptoms. Comorbidities may be present but do not preclude diagnosis when ME/CFS features dominate.\nNotes:\nSeverity is typically graded mild/moderate/severe based on activity reduction and need for aids/housebound status.\nPEM is the hallmark — characterize onset (immediate vs delayed), typical duration of recovery, and triggers.\nLong COVID / Post‑COVID condition (WHO clinical case definition, 2021)\nTiming:\nSymptoms usually start within 3 months from onset of probable or confirmed SARS‑CoV‑2 infection, and\nPersist for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by alternative diagnosis.\nClinical features:\nHistory of acute SARS‑CoV‑2 infection (confirmed or probable).\nCommon symptoms: fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction (“brain fog”), chest pain, palpitations, post-exertional symptom exacerbation, sleep disturbances, smell/taste dysfunction, muscle/joint pain, and others.\nSymptoms may be new following recovery from acute infection or persist from the initial illness; may fluctuate or recur over time.\nDiagnostic approach:\nConfirm prior infection (PCR/antigen or clinical/epidemiologic evidence when testing unavailable).\nDocument symptom timeline (onset, duration, fluctuation) and impact on daily functioning.\nRule out alternative medical causes with targeted testing guided by symptoms (e.g., cardiopulmonary evaluation for dyspnea/chest pain; neuro evaluation for cognitive deficits).\nNote on overlap with ME/CFS:\nMany people with Long COVID meet ME/CFS criteria, especially when PEM, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive impairment, and prolonged fatigue are present. Use ME/CFS criteria when illness duration >6 months (adult) and features fit.\nPOTS (diagnostic criteria)\nHemodynamic criteria on active stand or tilt-table testing:\nSustained increase in heart rate (HR) of ≥30 beats per minute (bpm) in adults within 10 minutes of standing or during head‑up tilt (from supine baseline). For adolescents (12–19 years), use ≥40 bpm.\nAbsolute orthostatic tachycardia often used with HR exceeding 120 bpm in some contexts.\nNo orthostatic hypotension: systolic BP drop <20 mmHg and diastolic <10 mmHg upon standing (if significant BP fall present, consider other diagnoses).\nSymptom criteria:\nChronic orthostatic intolerance symptoms for ≥3 months (lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, presyncope, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, exercise intolerance).\nSymptoms are relieved by recumbence.\nExclusions:\nSymptoms not better explained by other causes (e.g., dehydration, medication effects, primary cardiac disease, adrenal insufficiency, fever, anemia).\nConsider secondary causes of orthostatic tachycardia (e.g., deconditioning, medications, autonomic neuropathies) and evaluate accordingly.\nAdditional supportive features:\nExcessive pooling of blood in legs, abnormal autonomic testing, low blood volume, hyperadrenergic signs (elevated plasma norepinephrine when upright), comorbid Ehlers‑Danlos or mast cell activation in some patients.\nPractical testing notes:\nMeasure HR and BP after 5–10 minutes supine and then at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after standing (or during tilt).\nEnsure hydration, hold certain medications per guidance, and document symptoms during test.\nQuick differential/overlap points\n\nMany Long COVID patients report fatigue, PEM, cognitive problems and orthostatic intolerance; they may meet ME/CFS and/or POTS criteria. Evaluate for both when symptoms include orthostatic intolerance.\nExclude other causes with targeted labs and investigations: CBC, TSH, metabolic panel, ECG, orthostatic vitals, chest imaging or pulmonary function if dyspnea, cardiac work‑up if chest pain/palpitations, and appropriate neurologic/psychiatric assessment.",
