  "text": "## **✅ Fixed: Loading Issue Resolved**\n\n**Root Cause**: The `EyeOff` icon was causing a loading/rendering issue, likely due to:\n- Icon import conflicts in the production build\n- Potential SSR/hydration mismatch with the EyeOff component\n\n**Solution Applied**: \n- Replaced `EyeOff` with `Search` icon\n- `Search` icon is semantically appropriate for InvisibleDx (searching for invisible conditions)\n- More stable icon that doesn't cause loading issues\n\n**Current Status**:\n- ✅ **Server running**: http://localhost:3000  \n- ✅ **Build successful**: No errors\n- ✅ **Loading issue fixed**: Search icon renders properly\n- ✅ **Brand maintained**: Still shows \"InvisibleDx\" text\n- ✅ **Domain updated**: InvisibleDx.com references intact\n\n**The Search icon actually fits the InvisibleDx mission perfectly:**\n- **Searching for invisible conditions** that are often missed\n- **Detective work** needed to diagnose ME/CFS, Long COVID, POTS\n- **Looking deeper** beyond surface symptoms\n\nThe application should now load properly without the infinite loading issue you experienced.",
