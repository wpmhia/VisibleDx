  "text": "Remember:\nShort answer: the main shared, distinguishing symptom of both ME/CFS and Long Covid is post-exertional malaise (PEM) — worsening of symptoms after physical, cognitive, emotional, or orthostatic exertion that is disproportionate to the activity and can be delayed and prolonged. The way PEM shows up, its timing, triggers and duration can vary between individuals and between classic ME/CFS and some people with Long Covid, but PEM is the key overlap and a central diagnostic/functional feature.\n\nDetails you can use\n\nCore definition of PEM\n\nA worsening of symptoms (fatigue, cognitive problems/\"brain fog\", pain, sleep disturbance, flu-like symptoms, light/noise sensitivity, orthostatic intolerance) after mental, physical, emotional or positional exertion.\nDisproportionate to the exertion; not relieved by rest alone.\nMay start immediately, hours, or up to 24–72+ hours after the activity.\nCan last hours, days, weeks, or longer.\nHow PEM functions as the distinguishing/defining feature\n\nME/CFS diagnostic criteria (e.g., 2015 Institute of Medicine/US National Academy of Medicine, and other criteria) require PEM as a core symptom.\nMany Long Covid patients also experience PEM — that is why many Long Covid cases are described as \"ME/CFS-like\" or meet ME/CFS criteria when assessed.\nWhere they differ is often in onset cause (Long Covid typically follows SARS-CoV-2 infection) and in the broader, more heterogeneous symptom patterns among Long Covid patients (some never develop PEM; others do).\nPractical differences often seen\n\nTrigger: In ME/CFS the initial trigger can be various (post-infectious, stress, other) — in Long Covid the clear trigger is SARS‑CoV‑2 infection.\nHeterogeneity: Long Covid is a broader post-infectious/post-viral syndrome umbrella — some people have primary cardiopulmonary or clotting-related problems, or persistent viral reservoirs, or organ damage without classic PEM. Others develop classic PEM and meet ME/CFS criteria.\nTime course and prognosis: Many ME/CFS cases are chronic for years; Long Covid is newer and some people recover over months while others remain ill and progress to chronic ME/CFS-like illness.\nResearch and guidelines: ME/CFS has established diagnostic criteria and management approaches (pacing, symptom management). Long Covid research is newer; care pathways are still evolving and must screen for PEM because some standard rehabilitation approaches (e.g., graded exercise therapy) can harm people with PEM.\nClinical relevance for care\n\nAlways ask about PEM specifically: what triggers it, timing of onset after activity, how long it lasts, and which symptoms worsen.\nIf PEM is present, avoid therapies that push incremental increases in exertion (e.g., unadapted graded exercise). Use pacing/energy envelope strategies, prioritize symptom control, and refer to specialists (post-viral clinics, ME/CFS specialists) if needed.\nConsider comorbid contributors or organ-specific causes in Long Covid (cardiac, pulmonary, autonomic dysfunction like POTS, microclots, inflammatory sequelae) and investigate when indicated.",
