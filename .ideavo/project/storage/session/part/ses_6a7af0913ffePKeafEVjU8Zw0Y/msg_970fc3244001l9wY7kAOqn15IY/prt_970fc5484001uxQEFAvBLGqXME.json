  "text": "Yes, creating clinical case examples from guidelines is definitely possible and would be very valuable for the ME/CFS application! This can be done without AI - we can extract real clinical scenarios directly from established guidelines and medical literature.\n\nLet me analyze what we could implement:\n\n## Potential Case Study Features:\n\n### 1. **Interactive Clinical Cases**\n- **Source**: NICE NG206, UpToDate, medical journals\n- **Format**: Step-by-step diagnostic scenarios\n- **Purpose**: Educational tool for clinicians\n\n### 2. **Case-Based Learning Module**\n- Patient presentations with symptoms\n- Guided diagnostic reasoning\n- Differential diagnosis exercises\n- Treatment planning scenarios\n\n### 3. **Implementation Options**\n\n**Option A: Static Cases from Guidelines**\n- Extract real cases from NICE NG206 examples\n- Create interactive walkthroughs\n- No AI needed - just structured data\n\n**Option B: Template-Based Case Generator**\n- Pre-defined symptom combinations\n- Rule-based case assembly\n- Deterministic outcomes\n\n**Option C: Guided Case Builder**\n- Clinicians input patient data\n- App guides through diagnostic process\n- Real-time recommendations\n\n## What Would You Prefer?\n\n1. **Educational Cases**: Step-by-step learning scenarios for medical training\n2. **Clinical Decision Support**: Real-time guidance for actual patient assessments  \n3. **Case Documentation**: Structured templates for recording patient encounters\n\nThe most straightforward approach would be to create interactive case studies based on the clinical examples already present in NICE NG206 and other established guidelines. This would require:\n\n- Adding a new \"Clinical Cases\" module\n- Structured case data (symptoms, timeline, investigations)\n- Step-by-step diagnostic workflow\n- Educational feedback and explanations\n\nWould you like me to plan the implementation of clinical case studies, and if so, which type would be most useful for your application?",
