  "text": "Here are additional ideas to enhance the diagnostic platform based on current clinical needs:\n\n## Assessment & Screening Tools\n- **PEM Severity Scale**: Detailed characterization of PEM triggers, onset delay, duration, and recovery patterns\n- **Functional Capacity Assessment**: Activity limitation scoring (mild/moderate/severe/very severe)\n- **Orthostatic Vitals Calculator**: Automated POTS diagnosis with HR/BP tracking over 10 minutes\n- **Symptom Tracking Dashboard**: Daily/weekly pattern monitoring for fluctuating conditions\n\n## Clinical Decision Support\n- **Differential Diagnosis Engine**: Rule out other conditions (thyroid, cardiac, autoimmune, psychiatric)\n- **Red Flag Detector**: Identify when urgent medical evaluation needed\n- **Comorbidity Assessments**: Screen for EDS, MCAS, fibromyalgia, dysautonomia\n- **Pediatric Adaptations**: Age-specific criteria and severity scales\n\n## Educational Resources\n- **Patient Education Hub**: Condition explanations, pacing strategies, energy envelope theory\n- **Clinician Training Modules**: Recognition, assessment, and management protocols\n- **Research Updates**: Latest findings on pathophysiology, biomarkers, treatments\n\n## Integration Features\n- **EMR Export**: Generate clinical summaries for medical records\n- **Specialist Referral Generator**: Customized referral letters with assessment data\n- **Treatment Response Tracking**: Monitor interventions and outcomes over time\n- **Telehealth Integration**: Remote monitoring and virtual consultation support\n\n## Advanced Analytics\n- **Population Health Dashboard**: Aggregate anonymized data for research insights\n- **Predictive Modeling**: Risk stratification and prognosis indicators\n- **Quality Metrics**: Clinical pathway adherence and outcome measures\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these concepts or explore implementation approaches for specific features?",
