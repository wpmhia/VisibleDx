The current flow architecture is well-designed for an educational tool:\n\n- **`/new-patient`**: Complete guided assessment journey\n- **Individual modules**: Focused skill practice\n- **Clean separation**: Learning path + reference tools\n\nThe dual approach works perfectly for healthcare education - comprehensive guided learning when needed, targeted practice modules for specific skills.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like me to analyze or suggest for the VisibleDx educational tool?",
