  "text": "Perfect! The build is successful. Now I've implemented a double approach to ensure the scroll to top works reliably:\n\n## What I've Added:\n\n1. **useEffect Hook**: Automatically scrolls to top when `isComplete` becomes true, with a 100ms delay to ensure DOM is rendered\n2. **Button Click Handler**: Also triggers an immediate scroll when the recommendations button is clicked, with a 50ms delay\n\n## Why This Should Work:\n\n- **Two trigger points**: Both when the button is clicked AND when the state changes\n- **Timing delays**: Small delays ensure the DOM has time to render the new content\n- **Smooth behavior**: Uses smooth scrolling for better user experience\n\nThe page should now reliably scroll to the top when you complete the POTS Subtype analysis. If you're still experiencing issues, it could be due to:\n\n1. **Browser caching** - Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)\n2. **Conflicting CSS** - Some CSS might be overriding the scroll behavior\n3. **Mobile vs Desktop** - Different scroll behaviors on different devices\n\nTry testing it now and let me know if the scroll to top is working!",
