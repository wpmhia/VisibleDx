  "text": "Thank you for this comprehensive information about PEM as the key shared symptom between ME/CFS and Long COVID. This is valuable clinical context that highlights why our multi-framework diagnostic platform is so important.\n\nThe information you've provided reinforces several key aspects of our current implementation:\n\n1. **PEM as Central Feature**: Both our ME/CFS and Long COVID criteria sections properly emphasize PEM as a core diagnostic criterion\n2. **Framework Flexibility**: Our platform correctly presents multiple diagnostic frameworks since Long COVID can manifest as ME/CFS-like illness or have different presentations\n3. **Clinical Relevance**: The distinction between different onset triggers (various vs SARS-CoV-2) and heterogeneity patterns aligns with our separate but related diagnostic pathways\n\nThis context also suggests potential enhancements we could consider:\n- **PEM Assessment Tool**: A dedicated module focusing specifically on PEM characterization (triggers, timing, duration, symptom patterns)\n- **Care Pathway Guidance**: Clinical recommendations based on PEM presence/absence\n- **Cross-Reference Features**: Better highlighting of overlaps between ME/CFS and Long COVID when PEM is present\n\nWould you like me to implement any specific features that leverage this PEM-focused understanding, or does our current framework-agnostic approach adequately serve your clinical needs?",
