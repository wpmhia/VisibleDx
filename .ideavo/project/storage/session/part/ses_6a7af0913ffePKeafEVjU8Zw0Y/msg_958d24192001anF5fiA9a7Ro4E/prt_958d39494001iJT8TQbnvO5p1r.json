  "text": "Great! The build is successful. The issue was that the `createRedFlagSymptoms` function had a mismatch between the number of symptoms in the translation file (8 items) and the hard-coded ID array (6 items), which was causing undefined values and the React key warning.\n\nThe console errors you're seeing are mostly related to the development environment:\n\n1. **404 error for `/api/automation/reconnect/`** - This is likely from the development environment trying to reconnect to some automation service that's not relevant to your app\n2. **AudioContext warnings** - These are browser restrictions about audio that need user interaction first\n3. **React key warning** - This has now been fixed\n\nThe new patient assessment should now work properly without the React warnings and without getting stuck on loading screens.",
