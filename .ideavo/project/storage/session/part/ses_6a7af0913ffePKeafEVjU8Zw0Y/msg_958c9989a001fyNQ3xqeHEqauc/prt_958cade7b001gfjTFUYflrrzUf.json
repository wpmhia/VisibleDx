  "text": "Perfect! The build is successful. The issue has been fixed. The problem was that the red flag checker was trying to access translation data that didn't match the actual structure in the translation file. \n\n## Summary\n\n**Fixed:** The loading issue after completing red flag questions was caused by a mismatch between how the code was trying to access translation data for routine lab categories and the actual structure in the translation files.\n\n**Changes made:**\n1. Updated the `generateRecommendations` function to use the static `routineLabs` array instead of trying to access non-existent translation categories\n2. Updated the routine labs display section to use the static data structure \n3. Fixed the category matching logic to properly map selected categories to test lists\n\nThe red flag checker should now work properly and show results after completing the questionnaire instead of getting stuck on loading.",
